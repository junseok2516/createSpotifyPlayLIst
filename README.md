#Project Description
I'm currently learning Web app. using Python
This is to create a Spotify Play List based on Billboard Top100

## How To Use
1. Replace `spotify_ClientID` and `spotify_ClientSecret` with your own credentials.
(You can obtain these by registering on the Spotify Developer Dashboard)
2. Set the `redirect_URL` to a <u>valid</u> URL, ensuring it matches the one you provided in your Spotify Developer app settings.
3. Enojy :)
